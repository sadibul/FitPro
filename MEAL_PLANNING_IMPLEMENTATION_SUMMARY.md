# Meal Planning Flow Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented the complete meal planning flow as specified in the user's flowchart, connecting the Home Page → Plan Page → Meal Plan Page → Create Meal Plan → Completion Dialog → Back to Home with updated status.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated MealPlan Entity (Plans.kt)

- Changed `userId: Int` to `userEmail: String` for consistency
- Added `isCompleted: Boolean = false` field to track completion status
- This allows tracking whether a meal plan has been marked as complete

### 2. Updated MealPlanDao (MealPlanDao.kt)

- Updated all queries to use `userEmail` instead of `userId`
- Added `updateMealPlanCompletion(mealPlanId: Int, isCompleted: Boolean)` method
- Added `getLastCompletedMealPlan(userEmail: String)` method
- Updated all existing methods to work with the new email-based system

### 3. Database Migration (AppDatabase.kt)

- Incremented database version from 14 to 15
- Added MIGRATION_14_15 to handle:
  - Converting userId to userEmail in meal_plans table
  - Adding isCompleted field (defaults to false)
  - Preserving existing data during migration

### 4. Complete MealPlanScreen Redesign (MealPlanScreen.kt)

- **Target Calories Input**: Clean input field for setting daily calorie target
- **Create Meal Plan Button**: Creates meal plan and updates user's calorie target
- **Current Status Display**: Shows existing meal plan status and completion state
- **Mark Complete Button**: Allows marking in-progress plans as complete
- **Completion Dialog**: Modal dialog asking "Do you want to mark it as Complete?" with "Later" and "Done" options
- **Navigation Flow**: Proper navigation back to home after completion

### 5. Updated HomeScreen Integration (HomeScreen.kt)

- Added MealPlanDao dependency
- Added meal plan data collection: `currentMealPlan` state
- Updated Calories Plan card to show:
  - "Completed" when meal plan is marked complete
  - Target calories when meal plan exists but not complete
  - User's calorie target when no meal plan exists
  - "0" for new users with no target set

### 6. Updated MainActivity (MainActivity.kt)

- Added MealPlanDao parameter to both HomeScreen and MealPlanScreen calls
- Ensures proper data flow between components

## Flow Implementation Details

### Home Page → Plan Page

- Calories Plan card shows current status (0 initially for new users)
- Tapping the card shows calorie target dialog
- Plan page has "Meal Plan" button to navigate to meal planning

### Plan Page → Meal Plan Page

- "Meal Plan" button navigates to MealPlanScreen
- Shows clean interface for target calorie input

### Meal Plan Page → Create Meal Plan

- User enters target calories (validation ensures numeric input)
- "Create Meal Plan" button:
  - Creates MealPlan with automatic meal distribution (25% breakfast, 40% lunch, 35% dinner)
  - Updates user's calorie target in profile
  - Shows completion dialog

### Completion Dialog

- Modal with "Do you want to mark it as Complete?" message
- Two options:
  - "Later": Saves plan but leaves incomplete, navigates back to home
  - "Done": Marks plan as complete, navigates back to home

### Back to Home

- Home page now shows updated status:
  - "Completed" if plan was marked complete
  - Target calories if plan exists but incomplete
  - Updated Calories Plan card reflects the change

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Updated meal_plans table
CREATE TABLE meal_plans (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    userEmail TEXT NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    breakfast TEXT NOT NULL,
    lunch TEXT NOT NULL,
    dinner TEXT NOT NULL,
    totalCalories INTEGER NOT NULL,
    isCompleted INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    createdAt TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### Key Functions

- `mealPlanDao.insertMealPlan()`: Creates new meal plan
- `mealPlanDao.updateMealPlanCompletion()`: Marks plan as complete
- `mealPlanDao.getCurrentMealPlan()`: Gets user's current plan
- `userDao.updateCalorieTarget()`: Updates user's calorie target

### State Management

- Real-time updates using Compose State and Flow
- Proper coroutine scoping for database operations
- UI reflects database changes immediately

## User Experience Flow

1. **New User**: Calories Plan shows "0" → Can set target via Plan page
2. **User with Target**: Shows target calories → Can create meal plan
3. **User with Plan**: Shows plan calories → Can mark complete
4. **User with Completed Plan**: Shows "Completed" → Can create new plan

## Testing Status

- ✅ App builds successfully
- ✅ App installs without errors
- ✅ Database migration included
- ✅ All navigation flows implemented
- ✅ UI matches flowchart requirements

## Next Steps

The meal planning flow is now fully implemented according to the flowchart. Users can:

- Create meal plans with target calories
- View plan status on home screen
- Mark plans as complete via dialog
- See "Completed" status on home page after completion

The implementation maintains data consistency, provides proper error handling, and ensures a smooth user experience throughout the entire flow.
