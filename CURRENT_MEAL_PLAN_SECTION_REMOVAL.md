# Current Meal Plan Section Removal

## Change Made

Removed the "Current Meal Plan" section from the Meal Plan screen as requested by the user.

## What Was Removed

The "Current Meal Plan" card that displayed:

- Text: "Current Meal Plan"
- Target calories information (e.g., "Target: 2242 calories")
- Status information (e.g., "Status: Completed")
- "Mark as Complete" button (for incomplete plans)

## What Remains on Meal Plan Screen

✅ **Breakfast slider card** - Adjustable calorie slider
✅ **Lunch slider card** - Adjustable calorie slider  
✅ **Dinner slider card** - Adjustable calorie slider
✅ **Total Daily Calories card** - Shows calculated total (1500)
✅ **Create Meal Plan button** - Creates the meal plan

## Code Changes

### MealPlanScreen.kt

**Removed entire section:**

```kotlin
// Show current meal plan status if exists
currentMealPlan?.let { mealPlan ->
    item {
        Card(
            // ... Current Meal Plan card with status and mark complete button
        )
    }
}
```

**Result:** Clean, focused meal planning interface without the status display card.

## User Experience

- **Cleaner Interface**: Less cluttered meal plan screen
- **Focused Flow**: Users focus on creating new meal plans
- **Status Tracking**: Meal plan status still tracked via home screen Calories Plan card
- **Completion Flow**: Completion dialog still works via home screen tap

## Functionality Preserved

✅ **Meal Creation**: Users can still create meal plans with sliders
✅ **Status Tracking**: Meal plan completion status tracked in database
✅ **Home Integration**: Calories Plan card on home shows status
✅ **Completion Dialog**: Still appears when tapping home Calories Plan card

## Testing Status

- ✅ App builds successfully
- ✅ App installs without errors
- ✅ Meal plan screen shows only essential elements
- ✅ All meal creation functionality preserved
- ✅ Home screen integration unaffected

The Meal Plan screen now shows a clean, focused interface with just the meal sliders, total calories, and create button - exactly as requested!
