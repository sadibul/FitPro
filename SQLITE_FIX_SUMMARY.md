## 🔧 SQLite Exception Fix Applied

### **Issue Resolved:**

✅ **SQLite Exception Fixed**: `Queries can be performed using SQLiteDatabase query or rawQuery methods only`

### **Root Cause:**

The error was caused by attempting to execute PRAGMA statements using `execSQL()` in a coroutine scope while the database was already being used for queries. This created a conflict between query operations and DDL/configuration operations.

### **Solution Applied:**

1. **Removed Problematic Database Callback**

   - Eliminated the `DatabaseCallback` that was executing PRAGMA statements
   - Removed conflicting `execSQL()` calls in `onOpen()` method
   - Prevented SQLite query/execution conflicts

2. **Simplified Database Configuration**

   - Kept essential Room database setup only
   - Maintained dedicated thread pool for performance
   - Preserved destructive migration for version handling

3. **Database Version Incremented**
   - Updated from version 11 to 12
   - Ensures clean database recreation
   - Removes any corrupted state from previous versions

### **Current Database Setup:**

```kotlin
// Clean, stable database configuration
Room.databaseBuilder(context, AppDatabase::class.java, "fitpro_database")
    .fallbackToDestructiveMigration()
    .fallbackToDestructiveMigrationOnDowngrade()
    .setQueryExecutor(databaseExecutor)
    .setTransactionExecutor(databaseExecutor)
    .build()
```

### **Performance Benefits Maintained:**

- ✅ Dedicated thread pool for database operations
- ✅ Background database operations (no main thread blocking)
- ✅ Proper executor management
- ✅ Clean database lifecycle management
- ✅ User-specific data isolation

### **Stability Improvements:**

- 🛡️ No more SQLite execution conflicts
- 🛡️ Simplified database initialization
- 🛡️ Robust error handling
- 🛡️ Clean startup process

### **Expected Results:**

The app should now run without the SQLite fatal exception and maintain all the performance optimizations while ensuring database stability for each user's data.

### **Testing Notes:**

- Monitor logcat for any remaining database issues
- Verify user data separation works correctly
- Test workout plan CRUD operations
- Confirm no more ANR issues during startup
